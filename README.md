# Nonparametric-estimation-via-variance-reduced-sketching


## Introduction

This repository contains the Python implementation of the methods and algorithms presented in the paper "Nonparametric Estimation via Variance-Reduced Sketching". 

## Features

- Implementation of nonparametric estimation algorithms.
- Variance reduction techniques for improved performance.
- Example datasets and scripts for demonstration.
- Comprehensive documentation for each module.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: [NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Scipy, PyTorch]

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/Nonparametric-estimation-via-variance-reduced-sketching.git
cd Nonparametric-estimation-via-variance-reduced-sketching
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the code. For example:

To run the main algorithm on a sample dataset:

```bash
python main.py --dataset sample_data.csv
```

Include instructions for any scripts or additional modules:

```bash
python script_name.py --option value
```

## Examples

Include any example scripts or commands to demonstrate the functionality of your code. 

For instance:

```bash
